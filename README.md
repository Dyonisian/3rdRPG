# ThirdPersonRPG

#Warning - Project repository is missing two folders - StarterContent, and ParagonLtBelica to reduce size
#Both are free assets. Get them in the Epic marketplace, import them into an empty project, and then copy-paste into the content folder of this project for the project to work properly
